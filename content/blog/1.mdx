Welcome to the third iteration of this site.

Unfortunately, the last version had a few design flaws which only became more apparent the more I worked on it. Namely, the main "window" area was too small to fit all the content, particularly as I want the images in the gallery to be as big as possible. I thought I could fix this by simply making it scale with the screen size, but this ended up making the design look unbalanced and was a bit too distracting.

These issues were too large to ignore, so I decided to start over... (sort of)

I kept the original sort of aesthetic and vibe of the previous design, but leaned more into the whole "desktop" metaphor by incorporating a top statusbar and displaying "files" in the sidebar instead, reminiscent of an actual desktop.

As of writing this, I'm still working on the gallery and adding some more features but I'm pretty happy with how it looks so far. Take a look at the formatting :)
